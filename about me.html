	<p class="par">For 11 years I danced in ballroom dances and it was more than a hobby for me, I competed in many national and international competitions, I was the national champion many times and in international competitions I was in 27th place out of hundreds.
I am proud of my achievements and happy that I had this experience for 11 years. This field made me more mature, competitive, and above all with a lot of self-confidence.
